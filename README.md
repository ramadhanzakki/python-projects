# 🐍 Python Project Collection

> "A comprehensive collection of my Python programming projects, covering everything from core data structures and algorithms to practical scripts and automation tools."

## 🧭 Project Index & Navigation

This repository serves as a centralized portfolio for my Python practice and development work. Use the links below to navigate to each project's dedicated directory for installation instructions, usage, and specific project documentation (`README.md` inside each sub-folder).

## 🛠️ How to Run Projects

Since this is a collection, each project folder is self-contained.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    cd python-projects
    
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to a Specific Project:**
    
    ```
    cd [project-name-folder]
    # Example: cd calculator-app
    
    ```
    
3. **Setup Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    
    ```
    
4. **Install Dependencies:** _Check the `requirements.txt` file inside the specific project folder._
    
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```
    
5. **Run the Project:** _Refer to the project's specific `README.md` for exact run commands._
    
    ```
    python3 main.py
    
    ```
